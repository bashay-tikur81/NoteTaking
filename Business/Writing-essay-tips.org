* General Techniques
** Writing concisely
*** Avoid empty phrase
- Empty phrases are phrases that don't add any meaning to the paragraph, even when we
  remove them the sentence still holds its meaning. They are going to be assumed you
  use them in order to reach the word limit. You are just reaching the word limit not
  writing a good essay.
*** Avoid repetition
- Don't use words that have same meaning twice or more in one sentence.
  
*** Choose the best grammar structure
- The subject and verb of a sentence should reflect what is most important in the
  sentence. Choose the best way to write the idea in grammatical form.
  e.g: /it is, there is/ are frequently just extra words that weaken you sentence.
- Information in two or more sentences can often combined into one sentence.
