    Around fifty years ago, almost every work from collecting and processing big data, 
computing complex calculation, designing and engineering, transportation and navigation
to human communication was done by human labor. But nowadays these tasks which seems
very cumbersome to accomplish can be achieved within micro seconds, if not within
time scopes that humans can't realize, by the help of a simple but complex machine
called Computer.

These general purpose machines, the consumer decides to what purpose to use, are now
everywhere from space exploration to entertainment,so worth knowing it. I do believe that
any human being living in  this globe  will be affected by these machines either positively
or negatively. Therefore it is better to equipped yourself with the necessary knowledge
about this machine and its governing science.

For the first time I heard the term algorithm was when I was grade 9(Mathematics grade 9),
an Euclidean algorithm, an algorithm that can be used to compute multiplication of
two integers. Even though I didn't exactly know what algorithm meant at that time,
I was amazed by the precise steps that even a novice can multiply two numbers simply by
following these steps.

Since then I started asking what an algorithm is? what a computer is? How it works?
Thanks this amazing machine that makes communication very easy, I began surfing the web
and reading some old books about it that I found at our library, Kallamino Special
High school library. When I was grade 9, there was a nation wide Mathematics
competition called MIND PLUS MATHS and I scored a good result, then I went to Addis Abbaba
for next phase of the competition. When I returned from AA my father bought for me
a computer. Back then I became curious about computer science and helping my community
to uplift from the physical labor of working to computer aided working.
At the time of crisis that happened in the northern Ethiopia, I enrolled basic Java course
prepared by Mekelle University lecturers and earned my certificate in basics of Java.

A year ago my friend told me about addiscoder. At that time there was poor connection
at our region, I didn't found much info about it. But when the connection slightly
improved I tried surfing about addiscoder. I was excited to see many students of my age
are also enthusiastic for learning Computer Science and I wished to had any connection
with them to work for of our country. I appreciated your efforts to make this happen.

I am very interested in your programs because I believe that your program will help us
to collaborate with other scholars, to start our journey with best available way of
learning, to equipped us with necessary tools and techniques that leads us to solving
our community problems.


It's me Eleni Kahsay, Grade 12 from Mekelle, Kallamino Special High school.
