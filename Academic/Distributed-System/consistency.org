Active replication: request goes to all replicas and gets response.
High resource and high time complexity

Passive replication: request goes to the primary replica(main replica)and gets
response from the main replica.
Delay time.

consistency ensures that the data remains coherent and correct througout the
system.

consistency ensures that all users, applications, or services interacting with
the system see unified and up-to-date view of the data, regardless of which node
they access.

Some of the reason for consistency:
Data correctness
Data coherent - related data items or records stay logically coherent
Reliable operations
