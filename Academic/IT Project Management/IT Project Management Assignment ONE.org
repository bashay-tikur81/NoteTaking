* What is a project, and what are its main attributes? How is a project different from what most people do in their day-to-day jobs? What is the triple constraints? What other factors affect a project?
** What is a project?
A project is an organized endeavor with a specific objective to achieve within a defined time frame. It involves a set of interrelated tasks that must be completed to accomplish predetermined goals.
** Key Attributes of a Project:
    - Temporary: Projects have a clear start and end date.
    - Unique: Each project is distinct and addresses a specific need or opportunity.
    - Goal-Oriented: Projects aim to achieve specific outcomes.
    - Resource-Driven: Projects require resources (such as labor, materials, and equipment).
    - Managed: A project manager oversees planning, execution, and successful completion

** How Is a Project Different from Day-to-Day Work?
*** Projects:
        - Have a defined scope, timeline, and objectives.
        - Involve cross-functional teams.

        - Require specific planning and management.
*** Day-to-Day Work:
        - Involves routine tasks.
        - Is ongoing and repetitive.
        - Often performed by individuals.
        - Lacks the structured project management approach1.
** The Triple Constraints (Iron Triangle):
        - Time: The projectâ€™s deadline or completion date.
        - Cost: The budget allocated for the project.
        - Scope: The work required to achieve project goals.
    *These constraints are interconnected: Changes in one affect the others.*

** Other Factors Affecting Projects:
    - Stakeholders: Their expectations, needs, and influence impact project success.
    - Risk: Uncertainties that can affect project outcomes.
    - Quality: Meeting predefined standards and expectations.
    - Communication: Effective communication within the team and with stakeholders.
    - Organizational Culture: How the organization approaches projects.
    - Technology: Tools and systems used for project execution.
    - Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Adherence to laws and regulations.
    - Human Resources: Availability of skilled team members.
    - Environment: External factors like weather, market conditions, etc.34.

* What is project management ? Briefly describe the project management framework, providing examples of stakeholders, knowledge areas, tools and techniques, and project success factors.

** What is Project management?
It is the discipline of planning, organizing, and executing projects to achieve specific goals within defined constraints. It involves coordinating resources, managing risks, and ensuring successful project completion.
Key aspects of project management:
** Project Management Framework:
A project management framework provides a structured approach for managing projects. It encompasses methods, processes, tasks, resources, and tools needed to guide a project from initiation to closure.
The framework typically consists of three parts:
*** Project Lifecycle:
- The sequential phases a project goes through, including initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closure.
*** Project Control Cycle:
- The ongoing management and adjustment of project activities.
*** Tools & Templates:
- Resources used to facilitate project management tasks.
- An example tool within this framework is the Gantt chart, which visually represents project tasks and their dependencies.
** Stakeholders:
Project stakeholders are individuals or organizations actively involved in the project or affected by its execution.
Examples of stakeholders include:
- Project Manager: Responsible for overall project coordination.
- Team Members: Execute project tasks.
- Managers: Provide guidance and support.
- Resource Managers: Allocate resources.
- Executives: Make strategic decisions.
- Sponsors: Provide funding and support.
** Project Management Knowledge Areas:
These are essential areas that project managers oversee throughout the project life cycle. They include:
- Project Integration Management: Coordinating tasks, resources, and stakeholders.
- Scope Management: Defining project boundaries.
- Time Management: Scheduling and meeting deadlines.
- Cost Management: Budgeting and cost control.
- Quality Management: Ensuring deliverables meet standards.
- Human Resource Management: Managing team members.
- Risk Management: Identifying and mitigating risks.
- Procurement Management: Handling external resources.
- Communication Management: Effective communication.
- Stakeholder Management: Engaging stakeholders.
** Project Management Tools and Techniques:
Various tools and techniques enhance project management:
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): Segments large projects into manageable deliverables.
- Critical Path Method (CPM): Identifies critical tasks and dependencies.
- Scrum: An agile framework for iterative development.
- Kanban: Visualizes work and flow.
- Gantt Chart: Displays tasks and timelines.
- PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique): Estimates project time.
- Stakeholder Mapping: Analyzes stakeholder influence and interests.
** Project Success Factors:
Critical to achieving project goals:
- Clear Project Goals and Objectives: Well-defined objectives guide the project.
- Effective Communication: Facilitates collaboration among stakeholders.
- Resource Allocation: Properly allocating resources ensures smooth execution.
- Risk Management: Identifying and addressing risks.
- Stakeholder Satisfaction: Keeping stakeholders informed and engaged.

* What is a program? What is a project portfolio? Discuss the relationship between projects, programs, and portfolio management and the contributions that each makes to  the enterprise success.
** Programs and Projects:
*** Project:
- A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken by a company or organization to create a unique product, service, or result. It has a defined scope, resources, and schedule. Projects can vary in size and complexity, spanning various industries.
*** Program:
- A program is a collection of related projects and other work that share common objectives. Programs are often managed and coordinated as a group rather than independently. They aim to achieve strategic benefits by aligning multiple projects1. For example, a program could involve developing a suite of software applications for a company.
*** Portfolio:
- A portfolio encompasses different programs and projects within the same organization. These programs and projects may be related or unrelated. Portfolios help organizations manage their investments and align them with business goals and strategies.
Imagine a portfolio containing various programs, such as IT infrastructure upgrades, marketing campaigns, and product launches.
** Project Portfolio Management (PPM):
PPM is the centralized management of one or more portfolios. It enables executive management to meet organizational goals through efficient decision-making on portfolios, projects, programs, and operations.
PPM Lifecycle: PPM involves selecting, optimizing, and overseeing project investments. It aligns these investments with business objectives. The PPM lifecycle includes:
- Selection: Choosing the right projects and programs that align with strategic goals.
- Optimization: Efficiently allocating resources and managing costs.
- Oversight: Monitoring progress, risks, and benefits.
** Contributions to Enterprise Success:
*** Projects:
They create unique deliverables (products, services, or results) that directly impact customer value. Successful project execution ensures timely delivery and quality.
*** Programs:
Programs coordinate related projects, ensuring synergies and efficient resource utilization. They contribute to strategic objectives by managing interdependencies.
*** Portfolios:
Portfolios align investments with business strategy. By prioritizing and selecting the right mix of programs and projects, portfolios maximize value delivery.

Together, effective project, program, and portfolio management drive organizational success by:
- Executing Strategy: Projects and programs are the traction points for strategic execution.
- Creating Value: Projects directly create value for customers.
- Ensuring Survival and Growth: Organizations depend on effective project management for their mission and future strategies.
