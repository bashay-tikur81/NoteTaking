** Learning emacs for programming
- M-h: for selecting whole paragraph
- M-!: to enter shell commands
- N.B: In cases where the second letter is written by holding shift-key like !,<,
  .... you use "Esc-" instead of "M-" then write the letter with shift key
  In DIRED "m" for selecting or marking or "u" for

** Bookmark
- Bookmarks are used as a way of jumping to frequently used files and directries
  bookmarks in Emacs are permanent, they are saved to a bookmark file ~/.emacs.d/bookmarks
  
- C-x r m: Set a book mark
  C-x r l: list bookmarks
  C-x r b: jump to bookmark

** Emphasis and mono space
- You can make words '*bold*', '/italic/', '_underlined_', =verbatim=, +strike-through+

** Some other org-mode commands
- To insert link like this one by C-c C-l [[https://www.google.com][go to google]] and to follow the link use
  C-c C-o(check the link by hitting backspace and you will be amazed!!)
- You can also link to your own file by the same procedure but first you need to put the
  file on the link buffer by hitting C-c l on beginning of the file name.
