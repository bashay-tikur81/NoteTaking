* Terminal vs Bash?
- Terminal also known as console or command line interface(CLI), is the environment that you issue the bash commands. Terminal can run various command-line interpreters(or shells), like /zsh/, /bash/, /eshell/, ...
- Bash(Bourne Again SHell), is a specific type of command line interpreter or shell.
- In essence, the *terminal* is the interface you use to interact with the system, while *Bash* is one of the many shells you can run within the terminal. Think of the terminal as the stage, and Bash as one of the actors performing on it.
