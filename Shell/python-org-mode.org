When writing python snippets inside emacs org mode it won't work unless
you make a link between python and python3.

Linking Python to Python3
If youâ€™ve already installed Python 3 and still encounter python not fount 
issue, you can create a symbolic link:

sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python

This automatically aliases python to python3
